### An SMS alert system for my sister-in-law and her coworker


A learning and process for making and deploying a web application
where users can make save clients, appointments and have them recieve 
automated text messages either immidiately, day before, or on the day of 
the appointment.


I'm using Flask as my back-end cause that's the framework I learnt first, 
Bulma as a css framework and the rest of my front-end I basically just copy and
paste or spaghetti code by myself.

Twillio will manage text messages unless I find something better (free or cheaper).
