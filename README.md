### An SMS alert system for my sister-in-law and her coworker


A learning activity for making and deploying a web application
where users can make save clients, appointments and have them recieve 
automated text messages as reminders of those appointments.

I'm using Flask as my back-end cause that's the framework I learnt first, 
Bulma as a css framework and the rest of my front-end I basically just copy and
paste or spaghetti code by myself.

Twillio will manage text messages unless I find something better (free or cheaper).
